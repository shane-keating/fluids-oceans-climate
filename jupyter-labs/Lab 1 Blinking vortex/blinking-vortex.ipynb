    "## Blinking vortex flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The example we will study in depth is the *blinking vortex flow* (Aref, 1984). This 2D time-dependent flow is given by two vortices that alternately \"blink\" on and off with period $T$. Despite its simplicity, the blinking vortex flow produces very complex patterns of advection. In fact, it is a prototypical example of *chaotic advection*, a simple flow that produces chaos. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a single vortex centred at $(0,0)$, the flow is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = \\frac{K y}{x^2 + y^2}, \\qquad v = -\\frac{K x}{x^2 + y^2}.\n",

    "\n",
    "The strength of the vortex is given by $K$. For positive $K$, the vortex rotates clockwise; for negative $K$, the vortex rotates anticlockwise. \n",

    "The blinking vortex flow alternates the vortex center between $(\\pm a, 0)$. Thus, for $0 \\le t < T/2$, the vortex is centered at $(-a, 0)$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = \\frac{K y}{(x+a)^2 + y^2}, \\qquad v = -\\frac{K (x + a)}{(x + a)^2 + y^2}, \\qquad 0 \\le t < T/2,\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, the particle is initially released at the position $x_0, y_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the simple flow we have prescribed, we could easily solve this set of equations analytically: the particle trajectories are just circles (try to prove this yourself). However, this quickly gets complicated when you include time-dependence in the flow, even very elementary time-dependence as in this case. So instead we will use a well-known numerical scheme to solve the ODEs: the Runge-Kutta fourth order (RK4) timestepper. "
