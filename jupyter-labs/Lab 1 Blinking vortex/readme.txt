Click on the K symbol in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen (Application Launcher)

Click on File Manager > hdrive

Right click > Create new > Folder

Create a folder called "MATH3261" or "MATH5285" (as you prefer), then create a subfolder called "Lab 1"

Click Application Launcher > Applications > Internet > Web Browser (Firefox or Chrome)

Go to https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/, log in, and navigate to the MATH3261-5285 Moodle page

Under "Computer Labs", click on "Lab 1 Blinking vortex"

Click "Download folder", then "Open with (Ark Default)"

Open the folder you created ("Lab1") and drag the contents of the downloaded folder into it.

Type "jupyter-notebook". (Be careful to type it exactly, including the hyphen). This will open a new window in your web browser.

You will need to enter a "Token" to authenticate the notebook. In Konsole, copy/paste the URL provided into your web browser (or just right click > open link).

This will open a new tab in your web browser that looks like a file manager. In this window, navigate to hdrive/MATH3261/Lab1 and click on the file "blinking-vortex.ipynb"

You can now start working through the first lab!
