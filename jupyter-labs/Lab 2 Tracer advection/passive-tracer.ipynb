    "In real laboratory experiments, we often use colored dye to help visualize flows. By adding a few drops of tracer, we can see the complicated flow patterns and structures that form. In nature, the same thing happens with naturally occuring chemicals, for example water vapour (in the atmosphere) or chlorophyll (in the ocean). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a similar technique in our simulation using a kind of numerical dye called a *passive tracer*. Specifically, we will solve the *advection-diffusion equation in 2 dimensions*:\n",

    "where $D/Dt = \\partial_t + \\mathbf{u \\cdot \\nabla}$ is the advective derivative. In the limit of no diffusion, $K \\rightarrow 0$, an initial tracer distribution $C (\\mathbf{x}, 0)$ will be moved around by the flow $\\mathbf{u}$ without any change, i.e. it is conserved by the flow. In the absence of diffusion, the tracer would form narrower and narrower filaments with stronger and stronger gradients in $C$, without ever smoothing out. Eventually the filaments would become smaller than the gridsize of our domain, and the simulation would crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, we have added a diffusion term $K \\nabla^2 C$ on the right-hand side of the passive tracer evolution equation, with a very small value for the diffusivity $K$. The effect of this term is to smooth out small-scale gradients of $C$, ensuring that the simulation remains stable. Thus, the initial tracer distribution will eventually be dispersed throughout the domain, regardless of the advecting flow field.  "
